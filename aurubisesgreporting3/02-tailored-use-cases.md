# Aurubis AG - Tailored Use Case Scenarios

## Use Case 1: Real-Time Commodity Price Impact Analysis

### Business Challenge
Aurubis operates in a volatile commodity market where copper prices, treatment charges (TC/RC), and precious metal prices fluctuate daily. With $18.8B in revenue tied to metal prices, even small price movements have significant P&L impact. Currently, finance and trading teams spend hours manually aggregating data from multiple sources to assess exposure.

### How Facilis.ai Solves It
Facilis.ai can instantly analyze:
- Current commodity positions across all sites
- Price sensitivity scenarios (what-if analysis)
- Correlation between input costs and output prices
- Historical price patterns and anomaly detection

**Demo Prompt Example:**
> "Analyze our copper cathode inventory across Hamburg, Pirdop, and Olen. If LME copper drops 15% over the next quarter while treatment charges remain flat, what's our estimated margin impact? Compare this to similar scenarios in 2022-2023."

### Expected Outcomes
| Metric | Before Facilis | After Facilis |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Analysis time | 4-6 hours | 2-3 minutes |
| Scenario coverage | 2-3 manually | Unlimited |
| Decision confidence | Based on limited data | Data-driven with historical context |

### Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Connect to commodity price feeds and inventory systems
- **Week 3-4**: Configure sensitivity models and alerting
- **Ongoing**: Real-time monitoring and ad-hoc analysis

## Use Case 2: Multi-Site Production Optimization

### Business Challenge
Aurubis operates 8 production sites across 7 countries, each with different capabilities, costs, and raw material inputs. Deciding which site should process which materials to maximize yield and minimize cost is a complex optimization problem that currently relies on experienced operators and spreadsheet models.

### How Facilis.ai Solves It
Facilis.ai can analyze production data to:
- Compare efficiency metrics across sites in real-time
- Identify optimal material routing based on composition and site capabilities
- Predict maintenance needs before failures occur
- Benchmark performance against historical best

**Demo Prompt Example:**
> "Given our current raw material inventory (concentrates from Chile, scrap from Germany, e-waste from Richmond), recommend the optimal processing allocation across our European sites to maximize precious metal recovery while meeting our Q1 cathode production targets."

### Expected Outcomes
| Metric | Improvement Potential |
|--------|----------------------|
| Precious metal recovery | +2-5% yield improvement |
| Energy consumption | -8-12% reduction through optimization |
| Throughput | +5-10% by reducing bottlenecks |
| Planning time | 90% reduction in allocation planning |

### Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1-4**: Integrate production data from all sites
- **Week 5-8**: Build optimization models with operational constraints
- **Week 9-12**: Deploy and train operations teams

## Use Case 3: Sustainability & ESG Reporting Automation

### Business Challenge
With Copper Mark certification across 95% of production, carbon neutrality goals, and €780M in environmental investments, Aurubis faces intensive ESG reporting requirements. Currently, sustainability teams manually compile data from multiple systems for:
- Annual sustainability reports
- Investor ESG questionnaires
- Regulatory compliance documentation
- Copper Mark audit preparation

### How Facilis.ai Solves It
Facilis.ai can:
- Aggregate emissions data across all sites automatically
- Generate compliance reports in required formats
- Track progress against sustainability KPIs in real-time
- Prepare responses to investor ESG questionnaires

**Demo Prompt Example:**
> "Generate our Q4 carbon emissions summary across all production sites. Compare to our 2030 interim targets and identify the top 3 sites with the largest gaps. Include recommendations for reduction initiatives based on our hydrogen-ready furnace capabilities."

### Expected Outcomes
| Metric | Before Facilis | After Facilis |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Report preparation | 2-3 weeks | 1-2 days |
| Data accuracy | Manual verification needed | Automated validation |
| Audit preparation | 40+ hours | <10 hours |
| Investor response time | 5-7 days | Same day |

### Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Connect emissions monitoring and energy systems
- **Week 3-4**: Configure report templates (GRI, SASB, EU Taxonomy)
- **Week 5-6**: Train sustainability team and deploy

## Use Case 4: Supply Chain Risk Intelligence

### Business Challenge
Aurubis sources complex metal concentrates from mining partners globally (including Codelco partnership), manages scrap procurement across Europe, and operates a complex inbound logistics network. Supply disruptions, quality issues, or geopolitical events can significantly impact production.

### How Facilis.ai Solves It
Facilis.ai provides:
- Real-time monitoring of supplier risk indicators
- Quality trend analysis from incoming materials
- Geopolitical risk assessment for source regions
- Alternative supplier identification and comparison

**Demo Prompt Example:**
> "Analyze our copper concentrate supply chain risk profile. Flag any suppliers with declining quality trends over the past 6 months, identify concentration risks where we're >30% dependent on a single source, and recommend diversification options for our highest-risk materials."

### Expected Outcomes
| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Supply disruption response | 70% faster identification |
| Quality issue detection | Early warning vs. reactive |
| Supplier diversification | Data-driven recommendations |
| Procurement negotiation | Fact-based leverage |

### Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1-4**: Integrate procurement and quality systems
- **Week 5-6**: Configure risk monitoring and alerting
- **Week 7-8**: Deploy to procurement and operations teams

## Use Case 5: Competitive Intelligence & Market Analysis

### Business Challenge
As Europe's largest copper producer competing globally, Aurubis needs to monitor competitors (Glencore, Boliden, KGHM), track industry trends, and identify market opportunities. Currently, this relies on consultant reports and manual research.

### How Facilis.ai Solves It
Facilis.ai can:
- Monitor competitor announcements, investments, and capacity changes
- Analyze market trends from industry publications and filings
- Track regulatory developments across key markets
- Identify M&A opportunities in the recycling sector

**Demo Prompt Example:**
> "Provide a competitive analysis of European copper recycling capacity. What investments have Glencore, Boliden, and KGHM announced in the past 12 months? How does our Richmond plant position us vs. competitors in the US market? Identify any mid-sized recyclers that could be acquisition targets."

### Expected Outcomes
| Metric | Before Facilis | After Facilis |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Competitive updates | Quarterly | Real-time |
| Market research time | Weeks | Hours |
| Strategic planning input | Limited data | Comprehensive intelligence |
| Opportunity identification | Reactive | Proactive |
