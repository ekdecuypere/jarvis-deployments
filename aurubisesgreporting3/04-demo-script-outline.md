## Demo Flow (45-60 Minutes)

### Opening Hook (5 minutes)

**Pain Point Statement:**
> "Aurubis operates in one of the most complex industrial environments - managing 7 production sites across multiple countries, processing materials from dozens of suppliers, navigating volatile commodity markets, and meeting aggressive sustainability targets. Your teams spend countless hours pulling data from disparate systems just to answer basic questions like 'What's our current margin exposure if copper drops 10%?' or 'Which sites are on track for our emissions targets?'"

**Value Proposition:**
> "Facilis.ai gives your experts instant access to insights that currently take hours or days to compile. Let me show you what's possible."

**Transition:**
> "I've prepared some scenarios using representative data similar to what Aurubis would actually work with. Let's start with something your trading team deals with every day..."

---

### Demo 1: Commodity Analysis (8-10 minutes)

**Setup:**
> "Your trading desk needs to understand exposure across all positions. Currently, this requires pulling data from multiple systems and building spreadsheet models."

**Live Prompt:**
```
Analyze our copper cathode inventory and forward positions. If LME copper
drops to $8,000/ton, what's our estimated margin impact across all sites?
Which positions are most at risk?
```

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Instant aggregation across all sites
- Automatic scenario calculation
- Clear visualization of risk exposure
- Recommendations, not just data

**Expected Audience Reaction:**
- Finance/Treasury: "This would save our analysts hours every week"
- Operations: "We could make faster allocation decisions"

**Transition:**
> "Now imagine applying this same instant analysis to your production operations..."

---

### Demo 2: Production Optimization (8-10 minutes)

**Setup:**
> "With 7 sites operating 24/7, understanding which facilities are performing optimally and why requires constant monitoring and analysis."

**Live Prompt:**
```
Compare production efficiency across all sites for the last 6 months.
Which sites are below 90% capacity utilization and what are the main factors?
Identify any correlation between input material quality and precious metal recovery.
```

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Cross-site comparison in seconds
- Pattern recognition across multiple variables
- Actionable recommendations for improvement
- Historical context for anomalies

**For Operations Audience, Add:**
> "Notice how it identified the Pirdop maintenance issues affecting capacity, and the quality correlation with Beerse's scrap inputs."

**Transition:**
> "These operational insights directly connect to your sustainability goals..."

---

### Demo 3: ESG & Sustainability (8-10 minutes)

**Setup:**
> "With Copper Mark certification across 95% of production and carbon neutrality commitments, your sustainability team spends weeks compiling reports. Investors and regulators demand this data faster than ever."

**Live Prompt:**
```
Generate an executive summary of our sustainability performance.
Show total emissions YTD vs last year, progress toward 2030 targets,
and rank sites by emissions intensity. Identify top 3 decarbonization
opportunities based on our hydrogen investments.
```

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Board-ready format instantly
- Progress tracking against targets
- Connection to investment decisions
- Regulatory compliance ready

**For Sustainability Audience, Add:**
> "This same capability can instantly respond to investor ESG questionnaires or prepare for Copper Mark audits."

**Transition:**
> "All of this depends on reliable supply chains..."

---

### Demo 4: Supply Chain Intelligence (6-8 minutes)

**Setup:**
> "From Codelco concentrates to German scrap recyclers, you manage dozens of suppliers across multiple continents. A disruption at any major supplier could impact production for months."

**Live Prompt:**
```
Analyze our supply chain risk profile. Flag suppliers with declining
quality trends, identify concentration risks above 25%, and cross-reference
with geopolitical risk indices. What are our top 3 vulnerabilities?
```

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Early warning on quality issues
- Concentration risk visualization
- Geopolitical risk integration
- Specific mitigation recommendations

**Transition:**
> "Let me also show you something that helps with strategic planning..."

---

### Demo 5: Competitive Intelligence (5 minutes)

**Setup:**
> "Staying ahead of Glencore, Boliden, and KGHM requires constant market monitoring."

**Live Prompt:**
```
What recycling capacity investments have European copper competitors
announced in the past 12 months? How does our Richmond plant compare?
```

**Key Points to Highlight:**
- Real-time market intelligence
- Competitive positioning analysis
- Strategic implications highlighted

---

### Closing Value Proposition (5 minutes)

**Summary Statement:**
> "In the past 30 minutes, we've seen Facilis.ai:
> - Analyze commodity exposure in seconds vs. hours
> - Identify production optimization opportunities across all sites
> - Generate board-ready sustainability reports instantly
> - Surface supply chain risks before they become disruptions
> - Deliver competitive intelligence on demand
>
> Each of these would normally require specialists spending hours or days. With Facilis.ai, any authorized team member can get these insights immediately."

**ROI Framing:**
> "Based on similar deployments in industrial companies, we typically see:
> - 80-90% reduction in analysis time for standard queries
> - Faster decision-making on trading and procurement
> - Reduced compliance reporting burden
> - Earlier identification of operational issues
>
> For a company of Aurubis's scale, this translates to potential value of €20-50 million annually in efficiency gains and improved decisions."

**Next Steps:**
> "I'd suggest a pilot focused on one of the use cases we discussed - perhaps commodity analysis or sustainability reporting. We can work with a small team for 4-6 weeks to demonstrate value before broader rollout.
>
> What questions do you have, and which use case resonates most with your current priorities?"
